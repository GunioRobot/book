=head1 NAME

Release guide for the Perl 6 book

=head1 SCHEDULE

We'll release monthly, and (conjectural) release three days after each parrot
release, so the Friday after the 3rd Tuesday of each month.

We want a good version printed for the Rakudo * release, which implies that we
should finalize in mid March 2010.
