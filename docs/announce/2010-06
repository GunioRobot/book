We want a Perl 6 book. We want it badly enough to write it ourselves. So that's
what we're doing: writing one.

Changes/additions to the Perl 6 book since the previous release:

* Operators
    - comparison operators, smart matching
* Subroutines and Signatures
    - type constraints
    - captures
    - introspection
* Grammar chapter
    - fixed to work with newest Rakudo
    - use and explain proto tokens.

* Lots of rendering fixes
   (Some of these fixes require a new version of Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX, which
    isn't released yet. You can get it from http://github.com/moritz/Pod-PseudoPod-LaTeX
    Until these changes are released to CPAN, the adaptions in the book stay in
    the branch called 'ng'.)

You can download the preliminary PDF version of the book at
