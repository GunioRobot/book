We want a Perl 6 book. We want it badly enough to write it ourselves. So that's
what we're doing: writing one.

Changes/additions to the Perl 6 book since the previous release:

* Operators
    - created this chapter
* Subroutines and Signatures
    - created this chapter
* Regex chapter
    - Editorial review


You can download the preliminary PDF version of the book at
