We want a Perl 6 book. We want it badly enough to write it ourselves. So that's
what we're doing: writing one.

Changes/additions to the Perl 6 book since the previous release:

* Builtins chapter
    - created this chapter
    - added description of the Complex type
* Roles chapter
    - created this chapter

There have also been some changes to the support scripts and support
documents for producing the book.  These include:

* new HTML make target
* updated the release guide

You can download the preliminary PDF version of the book at
