This is a list of *technical* TODO items that needs to be solved

* footnotes produce some Mojibake
* non-ASCII-Characters (notably « and ») are silently missing from the PDF
* investigate syntax highlighting or emphasizing for the code examples
* investigate how to do proper cross-references
* code blocks preserve all leading whitespaces, leading to indented code
  examples - that should not be the case, or at maybe be optional
* maybe we need a more elaborate Makefile when we get more images
