We are writing a book about Perl 6.

It will be some kind of example driven introduction to Perl 6, and at
the same time showing off the reasons why we love that language.

We plan to have monthly releases, see docs/release-guide.pod

"We" are Carl MÃ¤sak, Jonathan Worthington, Patrick Michaud, Moritz Lenz and
anybody who's willing to work on it. If you're not on that list yet, you're
still very welcome to join us.

You can find us on #perl6book on irc.freenode.net.
