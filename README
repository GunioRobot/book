We are writing a book about Perl 6.

It will be some kind of example-driven introduction to Perl 6, and at
the same time showing off the reasons why we love that language.

We plan to have monthly releases, see docs/release-guide.pod

"We" are Carl MÃ¤sak, Jonathan Worthington, Patrick Michaud, Moritz Lenz,
Jonathan Scott Duff (Scott) and anybody who's willing to work on it.
If you're not on that list yet, you're still very welcome to join us.

You can find us on #perl6book on irc.freenode.net.
Logs of the IRC discussions: <http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6book/>
(If you do not have an IRC client, you can use a web-based client at
<http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=perl6book&prompt=1> )

To build the book, you need to have the following software installed:

    * GNU make
    * perl 5
    * the Perl 5 module Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX version 1.101650 or newer
    * inkscape (for svg -> pdf conversion) <http://www.inkscape.org/download/>
    * pdflatex
    * the 'bera' font as a LaTeX package
    * the 'fancyvrb' package for LaTex

      In Ubuntu 10.04 the last three bullet items are available from 
      the texlive-latex-base, texlive-fonts-extra, and 
      texlive-latex-recommended packages.
      On Mac OS X, they are part of MacTeX (TeX Live) 2009
      <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/> .
      Otherwise, you will need a TeX or LaTeX package for your platform
      to get pdflatex, and might need to install bera and fancyvrb manually.
      <http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/>
      <http://mirror.ctan.org/fonts/bera.zip>
      <http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyvrb.zip>

Just type 'make' on your command line, and the book should be built in
build/book.pdf
